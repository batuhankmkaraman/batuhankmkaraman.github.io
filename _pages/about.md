I'm a PhD student at Cornell University and Cornell Tech, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu]([https://www.google.com](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/)). My research interests are in machine learning and biomedical data analysis. Focusing on Alzheimer's, my current research builds deep learning methods for early detection of future decline and analysis of biomarkers.
