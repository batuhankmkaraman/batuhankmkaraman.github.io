## About me
I'm a PhD student at **Cornell University**, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/). Currently, I'm based in New York City where I'm affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. 

My PhD research focuses on developing deep learning methods for predicting clinical outcomes and analyzing longitudinal biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neoplastic diseases. 

During a summer 2024 internship at **Microsoft**, I contributed to **responsible AI** research, specifically working on supervised fine-tuning and alignment methods for Large Language Models.
