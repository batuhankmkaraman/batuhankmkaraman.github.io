## About me
I'm a PhD student at \textit{Cornell University}, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/). Currently, I'm based in New York City where I'm affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. 

My PhD research develops deep learning methods for predicting clinical outcomes and analyzing longitudinal biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neoplastic diseases.
Additionally, during an internship at \textbf{Microsoft} in the summer 2024, I worked on LLM safety, focusing on supervised fine-tuning and alignment methods.
