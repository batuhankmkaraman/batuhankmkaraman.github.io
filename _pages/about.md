## About me
I'm a PhD student at **Cornell University**, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/).  

During a Summer 2025 internship at **Amazon AGI**, I developed a novel REINFORCE-based RLVR algorithm for **reasoning LLMs** that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

During a Summer 2024 internship at **Microsoft AI**, I worked on **responsible AI** research, developing supervised fine-tuning and alignment methods to improve LLM safety and helpfulness.

My PhD research focuses on developing computer vision and time-series methods for predicting clinical outcomes from multimodal biomedical data.
