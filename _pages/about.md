## About me
I'm a PhD student at Cornell University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu]([https://www.google.com](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/)). Currently, I am based in New York City where I am affiliated with Cornell Tech and the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medical School. My research interests are in machine learning and biomedical data analysis. Focusing on Alzheimer's, my current research builds deep learning methods for early detection of future decline and analysis of biomarkers.
