## About me
I'm a PhD student at **Cornell University**, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mert Sabuncu](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/people/).  My PhD research focuses on developing deep learning methods for predicting clinical outcomes and analyzing longitudinal biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neoplastic diseases. 

During a Summer 2025 internship at **Amazon AGI**, I developed a novel REINFORCE-based RLVR method for **reasoning LLMs** that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

During a Summer 2024 internship at **Microsoft AI**, I worked on **responsible AI** research, developing supervised fine-tuning and alignment methods to improve LLM safety and helpfulness.
